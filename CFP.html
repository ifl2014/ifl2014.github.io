<h2>CALL FOR PAPERS: 26th SYMPOSIUM ON IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATION OF FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGES - IFL 2014</h2>
<h3>NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY/BOSTON, USA, OCTOBER 1-3, 2014</h3>

<p>We are pleased to announce that the 26th edition of the IFL series<br>will be held at Northeastern University in Boston, USA. The symposium<br>will be held from 1st to 3rd of October 2014.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively<br>engaged in the implementation and application of functional and<br>function-based programming languages.  IFL 2014 will be a venue for<br>researchers to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in<br>progress, and publication-ripe results related to the implementation<br>and application of functional languages and function-based<br>programming.</p>
<p>Following the IFL tradition, IFL 2014 will use a post-symposium review<br>process to produce the formal proceedings. All participants of IFL<br>2014 are invited to submit either a draft paper or an extended<br>abstract describing work to be presented at the symposium. At no time<br>may work submitted to IFL be simultaneously submitted to other venues;<br>submissions must adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy:</p>
<pre><code>http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication</code></pre>
<p>The submissions will be screened by the program committee chair to<br>make sure they are within the scope of IFL, and will appear in the<br>draft proceedings distributed at the symposium. Submissions appearing<br>in the draft proceedings are not peer-reviewed publications. Hence,<br>publications that appear only in the draft proceedings do not count as<br>publication for the ACM SIGPLAN republication policy. After the<br>symposium, authors will be given the opportunity to incorporate the<br>feedback from discussions at the symposium and will be invited to<br>submit a revised full article for the formal review process. From the<br>revised submissions, the program committee will select papers for the<br>formal proceedings considering their correctness, novelty,<br>originality, relevance, significance, and clarity.</p>

<p>Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers or extended<br>abstracts to be published in the draft proceedings and to present them<br>at the symposium. All contributions must be written in English. Papers<br>must adhere to the standard ACM two columns conference format. For the<br>pre-symposium proceedings we adopt a 'weak' page limit of 12<br>pages. For the post-symposium proceedings the page limit of 12 pages<br>is firm.
