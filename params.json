IFL 2014 will be a venue for\r\nresearchers to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in\r\nprogress, and publication-ripe results related to the implementation\r\nand application of functional languages and function-based\r\nprogramming.\r\n\r\nFollowing the IFL tradition, IFL 2014 will use a post-symposium review\r\nprocess to produce the formal proceedings. All participants of IFL\r\n2014 are invited to submit either a draft paper or an extended\r\nabstract describing work to be presented at the symposium. At no time\r\nmay work submitted to IFL be simultaneously submitted to other venues;\r\nsubmissions must adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy:\r\n\r\n[http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication)\r\n\r\nThe submissions will be screened by the program committee chair to\r\nmake sure they are within the scope of IFL, and will appear in the\r\ndraft proceedings distributed at the symposium. Submissions appearing\r\nin the draft proceedings are not peer-reviewed publications. Hence,\r\npublications that appear only in the draft proceedings do not count as\r\npublication for the ACM SIGPLAN republication policy. After the\r\nsymposium, authors will be given the opportunity to incorporate the\r\nfeedback from discussions at the symposium and will be invited to\r\nsubmit a revised full article for the formal review process. From the\r\nrevised submissions, the program committee will select papers for the\r\nformal proceedings considering their correctness, novelty,\r\noriginality, relevance, significance, and clarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### Organizers\r\n\r\n* Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, Chair\r\n\r\n##### Program Committee\r\n\r\n* Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, Indiana University\r\n* Rinus Plasmeijer, Radboud University Nijmegen\r\n* Atze Dijkstra, Utrecht University\r\n* Colin Runciman, University of York\r\n* Graham Hutton, University of Nottingham\r\n* Mary Sheeran, Chalmers University of Technology\r\n* Patricia Johann, Appalachian State University\r\n* Matthew Fluet, Rochester Institute of Technology\r\n* Josef Svenningsson, Chalmers University of Technology\r\n* Małgorzata Biernacka, University of Wroclaw\r\n* Peter Achten, Radboud Univerity Nijmegen\r\n* Laura Castro, University of A Coruña\r\n* Hai Paul Liu, Intel Labs\r\n* Kathryn Gray, Cambridge University\r\n* Lars Bergstrom, Mozilla Research\r\n* Lindsey Kuper, Indiana University\r\n* Nicolas Wu, Oxford\r\n* T.
