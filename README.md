#### Call For Papers

Available in [Plain Text](http://ifl2014.github.io/CFP.txt) and in
[HTML](http://ifl2014.github.io/CFP.html).


#### Scope

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively
engaged in the implementation and application of functional and
function-based programming languages.  IFL 2014 will be a venue for
researchers to present and discuss new ideas and concepts, work in
progress, and publication-ripe results related to the implementation
and application of functional languages and function-based
programming.

Following the IFL tradition, IFL 2014 will use a post-symposium review
process to produce the formal proceedings. All participants of IFL
2014 are invited to submit either a draft paper or an extended
abstract describing work to be presented at the symposium. At no time
may work submitted to IFL be simultaneously submitted to other venues;
submissions must adhere to ACM SIGPLAN's republication policy:

[http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication)

The submissions will be screened by the program committee chair to
make sure they are within the scope of IFL, and will appear in the
draft proceedings distributed at the symposium. Submissions appearing
in the draft proceedings are not peer-reviewed publications. Hence,
publications that appear only in the draft proceedings do not count as
publication for the ACM SIGPLAN republication policy. After the
symposium, authors will be given the opportunity to incorporate the
feedback from discussions at the symposium and will be invited to
submit a revised full article for the formal review process. From the
revised submissions, the program committee will select papers for the
formal proceedings considering their correctness, novelty,
originality, relevance, significance, and clarity.
